# Enumerable Methods
Enumerable is a module in Ruby that provides many methods that can help with traversal, transforming, sorting, and filtering. Any class that can implement the #each method can use Enumerable methods, which will then yield each item in the collection to a block.The main aim of this project is to create your own enumerable methods,which has the same behaviour with the normal methods.
